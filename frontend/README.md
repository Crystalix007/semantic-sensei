## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install`
(or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of the frontend:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
